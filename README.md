### Getting setup
* install git
* add git to your path
* install node
* add node to your path

Your going to have to google the instructions for the operating system you are coding on.  It's relatively trivial, but you will have to find the answer and follow the steps very carefully.  Finding answers using search engines is one of the most important skills to learn for programming.  I believe in you :wink:.

### Instructions

Type these commands in the Command Prompt (windows) or Terminal (OSX) after you have completed "Getting Setup".

`git clone https://github.com/nigelgilbert/pomodoro.git`

OSX: `rm -rf .git`

Windows: `del /s /q .svn`
`rmdir /s /q .svn`

`npm install`

`npm run start`
